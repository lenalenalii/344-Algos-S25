\section*{Problem 1}
There are $n$ children forming a circle. The $i$-th child currently has $a_i$ apples. Let $\bar a = \frac{\sum_{i = 1}^n a_i}{n}$ be the average number of apples that a child has, and we assume that it is an integer.

In one move, we can take one apple from a child and give it to an \emph{adjacent} child. What is the minimum number of moves we have to make to make every child have exactly $\bar a$ apples? Model this problem by a flow network with costs, and therefore show that this problem can be solved in polynomial time.

\section*{Problem 2}
Explicitly construct a bijection between each of the following pairs of sets and therefore show that they have the same cardinality.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Natural numbers and perfect squares.
    \item $(0, 1)$ and $(1, +\infty)$.
    \item $(-1, 1)$ and $\mathbb{R}$.
    \item $[0, 1]$ and $[0, 1)$.
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Problem 3}
Review the halting problem, and prove that the following problem is also undecidable: Given a Turing machine, decide whether it always correctly decides the set cover problem. (Note that the given Turing machine may not halt on a valid input, in which case it does not correctly decide the set cover problem.)

\section*{Problem 4}
Prove that the following problem is $\mathtt{NP}$-complete: Given $n$ positive integers that sum to $2W$, decide whether we can partition the integers into two parts with equal sum ($W$ each).

\section*{Problem 5}
Prove that the following problem is $\mathtt{NP}$-complete: Given a weighted directed graph with $n$ vertices and $m$ edges, decide whether the graph has a simple cycle with sum of weights equal to $344$. The weight of each edge must be an integer, but can be positive, negative, or zero.
